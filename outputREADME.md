### 🧩 CalcMaster 3000
CalcMaster 3000 is a powerful multi-mode number crunching engine built with Python. Designed for data nerds, finance students, and math teachers alike, this tool provides both terminal-based and programmatic interfaces.

### 🚀 Key Features:
- Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Advanced math: square roots, exponentiation, logarithms (base e/10/x)
- Statistical functions: mean, median, mode, standard deviation
- Number theory tools: prime check, factorization, LCM, GCD
- Scientific mode: angle conversions, trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
- Batch calculator: load hundreds of operations from `.txt` or `.csv`

CalcMaster logs all your calculations in a daily `.log` file with timestamps. It includes full error handling, color-coded terminal output, and verbose explanations in 'learning mode'.

This is more than a calculator — it's a personal math assistant. Future versions will include graph plotting, matrix operations, and symbolic algebra via SymPy.
